Hey! I'm John. I live in [Greenville, SC](http://www.lifeingreenville.com/). It's pretty. I have a wife, [Lauren](http://instagram.com/p/dm7aH2DGSA/), and a cat, [Wendy](http://instagram.com/p/QThppFjGWd/). We like going to [baseball games](http://instagram.com/p/pC3ZHRjGUR/), a [lot](http://instagram.com/p/nTWsfYjGYh/). I also met [this guy](http://instagram.com/p/qXuii-jGbg/). It was weird.

I graduated from [Furman University](http://furman.edu). It is also pretty. I've been a contract web developer since 2009. I like to work with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and more recently, [Meteor](http://meteor.com). I was part of the startup Vybe, a music aggregation iOS app which has gone the way of so many startups.

I co-founded a company called [BRDDG](http://brddg.co) with two of my buddies. We like building good things.

I have done work for [Newspring](http://newspring.cc). Currently, I'm helping to build a secret new platform for them.

Also, I have done a lot of work for [Bethel Music](http://bethelmusic.com) and [WorshipU](http://worshipu.com). I built their online school from scratch, including a custom video encoding and delivery solution built on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

In my free time, I like to make coffee and make music. I've made a few albums with my friends, check them out:

  - [Badlands](http://open.spotify.com/album/1xmeDQgLQXatnvOt8cbYOf) - Andy Lehman
  - [Songs of Sons and Lovers](http://open.spotify.com/album/2OpvGlmNqgAn4b6Ony0Kqd) - David Walker
