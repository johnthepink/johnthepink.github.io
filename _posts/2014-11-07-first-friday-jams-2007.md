Music is a really important part of my life. I play music a bit, and it also plays a large role in fueling my work day-to-day. So, I thought it would be fun to dedicate the first Friday of every month to music that I like (all judgements welcome).

This first installment is what my 2007 sounded like. Link [here](http://open.spotify.com/user/jpinkerton88/playlist/5Rx5vp0RW0NbTKM5jO7Eg3).
