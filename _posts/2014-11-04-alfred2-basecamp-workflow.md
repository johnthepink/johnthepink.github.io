![Alfred 2 Basecamp Workflow](/public/img/alfred2-basecamp.png)

Today I am open sourcing version 1.0.0 of my [Alfred 2 Basecamp Workflow](http://www.packal.org/workflow/basecamp). It started as a fork of the [Alfred 2 Ruby Template](https://github.com/zhaocai/alfred2-ruby-template), thanks guys. You can fork the repo [here](https://github.com/johnthepink/alfred2-basecamp).

After downloading, open the file to install, then:

1. Right click on the “bc” Script Filter and click “Configure”.
2. Fill out your Basecamp information. Note that if you belong to more than one organization, you can enter them separated by commas.
3. Have fun.

Pull requests are more than welcome.
