This month, I've been participating in the [24pullrequests](http://24pullrequests.com) challenge. The idea is that you use open source projects all year for free. So, why not spend December giving back?

I've been able to submit a pull request to an open source project for each day this month up until Christmas Eve. That's 24 pull requests to 8 different open source projects, including:

  - [opensit](https://github.com/danbartlett/opensit)
  - [24pullrequests](https://github.com/24pullrequests/24pullrequests)
  - [hours](https://github.com/DefactoSoftware/Hours)
  - [alfred-workflow](https://github.com/zhaocai/alfred-workflow)
  - [wp-stripe](https://github.com/humanmade/wp-stripe)
  - [mentoring.io](https://github.com/codebar/mentoring.io)
  - [nomcensus](https://github.com/despo/nomcensus)
  - [alfred2-basecrm](https://github.com/johnthepink/alfred2-basecrm)
