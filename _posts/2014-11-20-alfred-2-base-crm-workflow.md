After posting [my Basecamp Alfred workflow](/2014/11/04/alfred2-basecamp-workflow/) a couple weeks ago, someone contacted me about making one for [Base CRM](https://getbase.com/). I was not familiar with Base, but I was provided a trial account and did some research.

Today, I am [open-sourcing version 1.0.0](https://github.com/johnthepink/alfred2-basecrm) of the workflow. It will pull in your leads, contacts, and deals from Base. All you need is an API key. I hope it helps those of you that use it. Let me know if you have any comments, and pull requests are always welcome on [Github](https://github.com/johnthepink/alfred2-basecrm).

After downloading, open the file to install, then:

  1. Right click on the “ba” Script Filter and click “Configure”.
  2. Fill in your Base CRM api key.
  3. Start being productive.
