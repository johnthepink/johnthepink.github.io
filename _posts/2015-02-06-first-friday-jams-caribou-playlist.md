Last month, [Caribou](http://www.caribou.fm/) released a playlist on [YouTube](http://youtube.com) containing over 1000 songs that have influenced him over the past couple years. It's really incredible, and diverse. He knows music. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

I should mention there is also a [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/cariboutheband/playlist/4Dg0J0ICj9kKTGDyFu0Cv4) version of this playlist, but it's not near as comprehensive. 

Caribou also released a great album last year called [Our Love](http://open.spotify.com/album/5r4nz5LZHeGUcZCrWbfWkx).
